These fiels are Mandelbot using threads but dividing the width instead of height.

When you divide on width, the speed up is increasing all the time which is not the case when we divide on height. Here all the threads take same
amout of time to execute( to converge or to abort and return)

Steps to execute
1)Compile mandelbrot.cpp  mandelbrot.cpp -lpthread -stdc++
2)Run- ./mandelbrot

program will run three times using serial approach and will create nmandelbrot-serial.ppm file. The it will run for three times for 1,2,3.....8 
threads and will create mandelbrot-one-thread.ppm, mandelbrot-two-thread.ppm................... mandelbrot-eight-thread.ppm files.

Will give detailed output and will report the speedup using 1,2,3...8 threads over serial approach

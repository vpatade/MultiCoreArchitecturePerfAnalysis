Steps to execute
1)Compile mandelbrot.cpp  mandelbrot.cpp -lpthread -stdc++
2)Run- ./mandelbrot

program will run three times using serial approach and will create nmandelbrot-serial.ppm file. The it will run for three times for 1,2,3.....8 
threads and will create mandelbrot-one-thread.ppm, mandelbrot-two-thread.ppm................... mandelbrot-eight-thread.ppm files.

Will give detailed output and will report the speedup using 1,2,3...8 threads over serial approach

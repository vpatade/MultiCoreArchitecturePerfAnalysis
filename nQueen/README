Steps to execute
1)Compile
2)Run- ./nqueen <APPROACH> <N> [D] [T]
        
        APPROACH = 0 => Serial
	APPROACH = 1 => Threads
	APPROACH = 2 => Threads with Work Pool
	N = Number of queens
	D = Recursion depth for Threads and Threads with Work approach
	T = Number of worker Threads. Default will be 2.

When Approach = 0
            D and T are not needed and hence will be ignored
When Approach = 1
        D is needed T is not needed and hence will be ignored
When Approach = 2
        D and T both are needed if not specified, default configuration will be used
         Default Configuration: 
              D = -1
              T = 2

There are two files MatrixMultiplyThreads.c  and MatrixMultiplyColumnMajor.c. 
First program is using threads and second one is using threads with more optimized approach for better performance.
Compile both the files with -lpthread  option. 

Executing the files have following format

     MatrixMultiplyThreads.c [D] [R]    OR  ./MatrixMultiplyColumnMajor [DIMENSION] [R]
     
      D = Dimension of the Matrix. So mantrix will be D*D matrix
      R = No of Runs. No of times we have to run the loop.
   
      if we don't specify any thing, it will take D=1024 and R = 2


Both the programs will run for 1,2,3,.....8 threads one after another giving detailed output for each no of threads.
